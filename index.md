I am PhD student in the Code Recommenders subgroup of the [Software Technology Group][1] at TU Darmstadt.

  * 2013–now, TU Darmstadt, PhD student, advised by Mira Mezini
  * 2012, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, exchange student
  * 2009–2013, TU Darmstadt, master's degree
  * 2006–2009, TU Darmstadt, bachelor's degree

My general research interests include: developer-assistance tools, bug detection, mining software repositories, and software testing.
I lead [the Eko Software Campus project][2], in which we build [MuDetect][3], a developer-assistance tool that finds API misuses, i.e., incorrect or non-optimal usages of APIs in programs. I'm the project lead of [MuBench][4], a benchmark dataset and pipeline for API-misuse detectors.
In the past, I've also been a core contributor to [the KaVE Software Campus project][5], in which we built a developer-assistance tool that helps developers learn and use third-party APIs quickly and correctly in their work.

I serve on the following committees:

  * [FSE'17 Tool Demonstrations](http://esec-fse17.uni-paderborn.de/call_tooldemos.php)
  * [MSR'17 Mining Challenge](http://2017.msrconf.org/#/challenge)
  * [SANER'17 Tools Track](http://saner.aau.at/call-for-papers-tool-track/)

I am a teacher and student of Software Engineering topics in general. My activities include
[university-level courses](http://www.stg.tu-darmstadt.de/staff/sven_amann/),
[Code Retreats](http://letsdeveloper.com/2015/03/1st-darmstadter-legacy-code-retreat/),
[the Let's Developer YouTube Channel](http://youtube.com/letsdeveloper),
and individual consultancy.
