abstract: >
  Over the last years, researchers proposed a variety of assistance tools to support developers in their development environments. Many of the respective publications introduce new evaluation strategies or use custom datasets. Size and quality of the performed evaluations differ. Additionally, the strategies often use metrics that are tailored to the respective tools. As a result, comparing different assistance tools is very difficult.
  In this work, we present a framework for the standardized evaluation of assistance tools, on the example of code recommenders. The framework combines different ideas and demands from previous work. Furthermore, we discuss how the community could jointly realize the framework.
